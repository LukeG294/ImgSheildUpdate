          <p class="subtitle"> The Kingdom of Mali was located in Western Africa on the upper Niger river in the 13th to 16th century. It was named Kangaba at the time. </p>
          <p class="subtitle"> Mostly flat, plateaus, rivers including the Niger and Senegal. The northern part has a climate like a hot desert, and all of Mali receives little rain. The Niger river is a source of drinking water, food, and transportation. To the North, the Sahara desert is one of the hottest parts of this regation. 65% of the total land in Mali is desert.</p>
          <p class="subtitle"> The Niger river flooded the land and provided fertile land for agriculture, but the climate was still dangerously hot. There were desert sandstorms and many droughts.
